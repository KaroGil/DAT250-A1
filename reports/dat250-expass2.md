# Technical report on assignment 2 DAT250

## Technical problems that you encountered during installation and how you resolved
I initially wanted to use IntelliJ as my IDE but ran into some issues when trying to open the Spring project. To keep things moving, I switched to VS Code for the time being, which worked smoothly. Aside from that, I didnâ€™t encounter any major technical problems. The real challenge of this task was understanding how everything was supposed to integrate, the various dependencies, and how the different classes were interconnected. After revisiting the task and taking time to understand the requirements better, I was able to grasp the overall structure and implement the solution for this task.

## Any pending issues with this assignment that you did not manage to solve
To my knowledge, no major issues are still pending as far as the MVP for this task goes. But there are always new ways to improve and broaden the application with new features or extensions of old features.
