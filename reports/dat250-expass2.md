# Technical report on assignment 2 DAT250

## Technical problems that you encountered during installation and how you resolved
I wanted to use Intellij as my IDE but I encountered some issues with opening the spring project. I resolved this by switching to VScode as my IDE for now.

It was hard to understand how everything was meant to connect to each other. What the different dependencies for each class were and how they interconnected. How they were meant to be structured and work.

## Any pending issues with this assignment that you did not manage to solve
